Playing with webpack
====================

This exercise covers installing Webpack, configuring it, and adding loaders for CSS, SASS, HTML, and Files. It also includes cache busting, setting up a dev server, and splitting up development and production config files. We incorporate multiple Webpack plugins including clean-webpack-plugin ,mini-css-extract-plugin,  optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin, terser-webpack-plugin, and html-webpack-plugin.
